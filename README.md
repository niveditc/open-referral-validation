OpenReferral Validation Tool
============================
This is a validation tool for validating human services data according to the [OpenReferral specification](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/blob/master/README.md). The tool is temporarily hosted [here](http://niveditc.github.io/open-referral-validation/).

Currently, the tool corresponds to an older version of the specification and is [being updated](https://github.com/niveditc/open-referral-validation/issues/2) to match the current specification.

The validation tool was made in response to this [hack request](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/issues/36).
