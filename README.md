OpenReferral Validation Tool
============================
This is a validation tool for validating human services data according to the OpenReferral specification.

The specification for OpenReferral can be found [here](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/blob/master/README.md)
Currently, the tool corresponds to an older version of the specification and is being updated to match the current specification.

This validation tool is being made in response to this [hack request](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/issues/36)
